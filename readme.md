# Calculator 

## Part I:
1. ~Create your project using npm init~
2. Using npm, add your favorite CSS framework
3. ~Implement the main layout and wireframe of the calculator (that is, the grid of all buttons
and other elements)~
4. ~Add the relevant UI elements in their locations according to the given diagram~
a. ~Only the elements shown in the main panel should be added in this part~
b. ~Don’t try to implement their functionally yet, you will do it later~
5. ~Give an ID for each button and element in the UI~
6. ~For each element, set its styling configuration (color, hover,clicked etc.)~
a. ~Remember, there should be a light and dark mode for the app.~
b. ~In this part you should only build these two modes and pick one as the active style
(using css), in next stages we will allow the user to toggle between the two modes.~

7. ~Read, learn, and experiment with the onClick event.~
8. ~Read, learn, and experiment with the alert function.~
9. ~Implement the “info” button functionality so that when the user clicks on the info icon an
alert popup will be open with the following information:~
a. ~Developer’s name~
b. ~Calculator’s version (stage)~
c. ~Short description of this app~
d. ~Each piece of information should be written in its own separated line~
10. ~For each button add an onclick event calling the displayButtonInfo function.
a. You should add a “displayButtonInfo (value)” function to your html, this function will
call alert and display the given value passed to it so that clicking on a button will
alert a message with its name (for instance, clicking on 9 will pop a message with the
message 9, clicking on + will pop the message “+”.~

11. ~Build config.html file
This page should have a form with the following elements:~
a. ~Dropdown list, allowing the user to choose page’s background color (list of 5 colors).
Bonus, try to embed a palette chose competent to your form~
b. ~Dropdown list, allowing the user to choose pages font family (list of 5).~
